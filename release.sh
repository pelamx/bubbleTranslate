bubbleTranslate — by pelamx

1. Drag bubbleTranslate.app onto the Applications folder.

2. Launch it. macOS blocks the first launch and says it "could not verify"
   the app — this app is not notarized by Apple. Dismiss that, then open
   System Settings > Privacy & Security, scroll to Security, and click
   "Open Anyway". This is only needed once.

   (Control-click > Open does not work for this on macOS 15 and later.)

3. macOS will ask for Accessibility permission, and the app opens the page
   for you: System Settings > Privacy & Security > Accessibility. Turn
   bubbleTranslate on there.

   It starts watching the moment you do. Nothing to quit, nothing to relaunch.

Then select text anywhere — double-click a word, drag a phrase, triple-click
a line — and the translation appears at your cursor.

The app has no Dock icon while it runs in the background. Look for the globe
in the menu bar to reopen the window or quit.
